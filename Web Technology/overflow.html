    <h1>Use of overflow property</h1>
    <div>A CSS pseudo-class is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected element(s).
        For example, the pseudo-class :hover can be used to select a button when a user's pointer hovers over the button
        and this selected button can then be styled.

        CSS
        Copy to Clipboard
        /* Any button over which the user's pointer is hovering */
        button:hover {
        color: blue;
        }
        A pseudo-class consists of a colon (:) followed by the pseudo-class name (e.g., :hover). A functional
        pseudo-class also contains a pair of parentheses to define the arguments (e.g., :dir()). The element that a
        pseudo-class is attached to is defined as an anchor element (e.g., button in case button:hover).

        Pseudo-classes let you apply a style to an element not only in relation to the content of the document tree, but
        also in relation to external factors like the history of the navigator (:visited, for example), the status of
        its content (like :checked on certain form elements), or the position of the mouse (like :hover, which lets you
        know if the mouse is over an element or not).

        Note: In contrast to pseudo-classes, pseudo-elements can be used to style a specific part of an element.

        Element display state pseudo-classes
        These pseudo-classes enable the selection of elements based on their display states.

        :fullscreen
        Matches an element that is currently in fullscreen mode.

        :modal
        Matches an element that is in a state in which it excludes all interaction with elements outside it until the
        interaction has been dismissed.

        :picture-in-picture
        Matches an element that is currently in picture-in-picture mode.

        Input pseudo-classes
        These pseudo-classes relate to form elements, and enable selecting elements based on HTML attributes and the
        state that the field is in before and after interaction.
